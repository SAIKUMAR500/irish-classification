Iris Flower Classification is one of the most popular case studies among the data science community. Almost every data science newbie has solved this case study once in their life. Here, you are given the measurements associated with each species of iris flower and based on this data, you have to train a machine learning model for the task of classifying iris flowers. So if you are new to machine learning and have never tried to solve this case study, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through Iris Flower Classification with machine learning using Python.

Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

I hope you now have understood the case study of iris flower classification. Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning. Now in the section below, I will take you through how we can classify the iris flower species with machine learning using the Python programming language.
